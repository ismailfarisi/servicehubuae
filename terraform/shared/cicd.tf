# ─── GitHub Actions OIDC Provider (account-global) ────────────
# Lets GitHub Actions assume an IAM role without storing static AWS keys.
# AWS permits exactly one OIDC provider per URL per account, so this is shared
# by every environment. Originally declared in terraform/staging; moved here
# when staging migrated to Netcup. terraform/production/cicd.tf does a
# `data "aws_iam_role" "github_actions"` lookup against the role below and
# attaches its own prod-scoped policy — do NOT destroy these while prod is
# still on AWS.
