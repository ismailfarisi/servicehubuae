# CI test runner — UNIT TESTS ONLY.
#
# The PR/prod pipelines have no Postgres or Redis, so integration tests
# (*.integration.test.ts and tests/integration/**) cannot run here. Loading a
# whole service's suite in one bun process also surfaces a load-order
# circular-import in @mypickuae/guards that only bites when the integration
# files are present. Both problems are avoided by running unit tests only.
#
# Integration tests should be run separately against a live stack (tracked as
# future CI-infra work: add Postgres + Redis service containers and a
# `test:integration` step). Run them locally with `bun test` (full suite) when
# your docker stack is up.
#
# Runs from the repo root (where the workflows invoke it). Each service runs in
# its own bun process to preserve per-service isolation.

# Running total of integration files CI did NOT run, reported at the end. A
# green check here covers unit tests only; booking-service in particular keeps

# Two complementary measures make this deterministic:
#   1. --preload fully evaluates the libs/database + guards barrels (100+
#      interlinked TypeORM entities) BEFORE the test file's own imports, so the
#      barrel is never observed mid-evaluation ("Export named X not found").
#   2. Each test FILE runs in its own bun process, so a route test that
#      mock.module("../container.ts")s always wins — no sibling file can load the
#      container first and defeat the mock.
# Either alone flaps between CI runs; together they are stable.
