// calendar-feed-url.service.ts
//
// Phase 6 Task 5 — issues the signed outbound `.ics` feed URL for a staff
// member, for a vendor location manager to paste into their other platform's
// "subscribe to calendar" field. Deterministic: calling `issue` again for the
// same staff member returns the SAME URL every time — the token is a pure
// HMAC over the staff id (ical-feed-token.ts) with no stored/rotatable
// per-issue state, so there's nothing to look up or regenerate.
//
// ── Scoping (mirrors CalendarSubscriptionService.assertStaffAccess) ─────────
// staff_engagements/staff_members carry no location column directly usable
// here, so a non-owner/manager actor is authorized against the staff
// member's LINKED locations: they must hold a managing location_membership
// for EVERY one of them (isLocationManagerOfAll — see review finding 7; this
// URL embeds a bearer token granting read of the staff member's whole
// schedule across all their branches, so ANY-branch authority was too weak).
// Owner/vendor-manager keep the unrestricted fast path. This duplicates
// CalendarSubscriptionService's private `assertStaffAccess` rather than
// importing it — that method is private, and the two services address
// different concerns (inbound subscription CRUD vs. outbound feed URL
// issuance) that happen to share the same authorization shape. Both go
// through the same underlying `isVendorManagerRole`/`isLocationManagerOfAll`
// helpers from guards/location-scope.ts, so the actual authorization LOGIC
// is not duplicated, only the staff-lookup plumbing around it.
