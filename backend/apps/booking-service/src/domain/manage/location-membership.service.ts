// location-membership.service.ts
//
// Task 0B (Phase 7) — HTTP CRUD for `location_memberships` (grant/list/revoke a
// per-location managing role). Before this, the table/entity/guard logic
// existed (assertLocationManager consumes it) but a per-location role could
// only be granted by a direct DB write — there was no route for an admin UI to
// call (recon gotcha #8).
//
// ── Authorization (binding, stricter than the other manage routes) ───────────
// ALL three operations require the outer `vendorMembership("products.write")`
// gate AND a vendor-wide `owner`/`manager` role. A location-admin must NOT
// manage memberships — otherwise a per-location manager could self-grant or
// escalate another branch's access (privilege escalation). This is why the
// check is `isVendorManagerRole` (owner/manager only), NOT `assertLocationManager`
// (which a location-admin passes for their own branch). The target location
// must belong to the active vendor (404 otherwise).
//
// ── Grant is a SUBSET of vendor membership (binding) ─────────────────────────
// POST rejects a `user_id` that isn't an ACTIVE vendor_members row of the same
// vendor (422) — a location grant can only ever narrow an existing vendor
// member to a branch, never be a backdoor that admits a non-member into the
// vendor.
//
// ── Duplicate handling (binding — find-then-write, NOT repo.upsert) ───────────
// Keyed on (vendor_location_id, user_id). A bare `repo.upsert(..., ["...","..."])`
// emits an ON CONFLICT that does NOT match this table's partial unique index
// (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) and 500s (the documented TypeORM partial-index
// gotcha). So POST does a find-then-write inside a transaction: an existing
// ACTIVE row is updated in place; a soft-deleted row is reactivated
// (deleted_at -> null, role updated); only a genuinely-new (location,user) pair
// inserts. The active row is preferred over any soft-deleted history so
// restoring never races the partial unique index into two live rows.
