// manage-booking-actions.controller.ts
//
// Task 0B (Phase 7) — the vendor/location-manager surface for the three
// booking MUTATIONS the recon flagged as missing: complete, no-show, and
// reschedule. Mirrors block-time.controller.ts's split: this controller owns
// only the AUTHORIZATION in front (vendor ownership + location scope) and then
// DELEGATES to the exact same money-moving services the admin routes /
// auto-complete job already use — it adds zero new money logic.
//
// ── Shared authorization (spec §8 vendor surface) ────────────────────────────
// The outer route gates on `vendorMembership("products.write")` (the only
// booking permission string). On TOP of that, per booking:
//   - the booking must exist AND belong to the active vendor
//     (`vendor_id === actor.vendorId`); anything else is a 404 (hide existence,
//     mirroring DELETE /manage/blocks/:id — never leak that a booking exists
//     for another vendor).
//   - location scope: a booking tied to a branch (`location_id` non-null) runs
//     `assertLocationManager` (owner/manager pass vendor-wide; any other role
//     needs an active managing location_membership for THAT branch). A
//     home-visit booking (`location_id` null) has no branch to scope to, so —
//     mirroring the review-reply reasoning — it's owner/manager only.
// The actor handed to the underlying service is a NON-customer ("vendor")
// actor: the customer self-serve windows (reschedule window) do not gate the
// vendor, but the services' own state-machine + no-show-window + manual-source
// rules still stand (they're actor-independent).
