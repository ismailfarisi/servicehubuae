// block-time.service.ts
//
// Phase 6 Task 2 (spec off-platform capacity). A vendor location manager
// blocks a staff member's time (`manual_block` — e.g. "closed for
// stocktake") or logs a `break` directly against the SAME `staff_engagement`
// capacity ledger every other engagement source (marketplace booking,
// walk-in/phone, external import) writes to.
//
// ── Binding design decision (mirrors Task 1's manual-booking.service.ts) ───
// ENGAGEMENT-ONLY. Unlike a walk-in/phone booking (which sometimes writes a
// `bookings` row so the vendor calendar shows a customer name), a block has
// no customer and nothing to show beyond "staff is busy" — a `bookings` row
// would be dead weight here, so this service NEVER writes one.
//
// ── `reason` storage decision ───────────────────────────────────────────
// `staff_engagements` has no notes/reason column (see the entity) and this
// task is scoped to NOT add a migration for one. The optional `reason` is
// piggybacked onto the ledger's existing free-text `external_source` column
// instead. Only manual_block/break rows use it this way; Phase 6 Task 6's
// iCal import will also populate `external_source` (on `external_import`-
// kind rows, identifying the feed) — the two never collide in practice
// because they're gated by different `kind` values, but Task 6's db-design
// write-up should call out that the column is now dual-purposed (block
// reason vs. import feed identifier) rather than treat it as single-purpose.
//
// ── Authorization decision (create vs. list/delete) ─────────────────────
// `create` takes a `vendor_location_id` directly, so the location-scoped
// `assertLocationManager` check runs in BlockTimeController.create (mirrors
// ManualBookingController.create — Task 1's own precedent) BEFORE this
// service is ever called; this service then only re-checks that the staff
// member belongs to the active vendor and is linked to that location
// (mirrors ManualBookingService.create's own staff/link checks).
//
// `list`/`delete` take no location id (staff_engagements has no location
// column), so this service derives it: `list()` resolves the actor's
// managing location(s) via `getManagedLocationIds` (or the single queried
// `vendor_location_id` via `assertLocationManager` directly, when supplied)
// and restricts the result set through the same `staff_locations` join it
// already uses for the `vendorLocationId` filter; `delete()` resolves the
// target engagement's `staff_member_id` -> linked `vendor_location_id`s and
// runs `isLocationManagerOfAll` against them. Owner/vendor-manager roles keep
// their unrestricted fast path (identical behavior to before this fix) —
// only a non-owner/manager actor is location-checked at all.
//
// This isn't defense against a hypothetical: the seeded `role_permissions`
// matrix only grants `products.write` to `owner`/`manager` today, but
// `PUT /admin/role-permissions/:role` (vendor-service,
// role-permissions-admin.routes.ts) lets a super_admin grant it to a
// location-scoped role (e.g. `staff`) via a single authenticated live call —
// no deploy, picked up by every process within the matrix cache's ~30s TTL.
// Without this check, that grant would let a location-scoped actor list and
// release ANY block/break at ANY of the vendor's locations, not just the
// branch they were delegated. The vendor_id scoping stays in place
// regardless (this is a same-vendor, cross-location gap, never
// cross-vendor).
