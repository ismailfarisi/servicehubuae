// Queue-singleton + thin-Worker shape, but this queue carries per-booking
// DELAYED jobs keyed by a stable jobId (`auth:{bookingId}` /
// `auth-followup:{bookingId}`) rather than a repeatable cron schedule — the
// same `{delay, jobId}` idiom apps/product-service/src/domain/flash-deal
// /effects.ts already uses for its per-deal expiry job.

/**
 * PHASE 7 REVIEW FIX #3 — money-critical retries for BOTH job names on this
 * queue (`authorize` and `follow-up-cancel`).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: the queue was constructed with no `defaultJobOptions`,
 * so BullMQ defaulted to `attempts: 1`. `BookingAuthService.runAuthorizeJob`
 * opens with a `bookingRepo.findOne` that sits OUTSIDE any try/catch, so a
 * single DB hiccup at fire time threw straight out of the worker and
 * PERMANENTLY lost that booking's prepay off-session authorization — no
 * retry, no notification, no re-schedule. The prepay booking then reached
 * completion with nothing authorized (see also fix #4 in
 * booking-completion.service.ts, which is the second half of that same
 * failure). `follow-up-cancel` has the same exposure: losing it means a
 * booking whose auth failed is never auto-cancelled and its slot is never
 * freed.
 *
 * Exported as a named constant so the CI unit suite can assert the policy
 * without constructing a Queue (which would need a live Redis). Mirrors the
 * sibling `booking-autocomplete` queue's policy verbatim
 * (getBookingAutoCompleteQueue) — the two are the same class of
 * money-critical per-booking delayed job and must not drift.
