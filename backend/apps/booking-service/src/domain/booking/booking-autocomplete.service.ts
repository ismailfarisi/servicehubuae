// Phase 5 Task 5b (spec §5.3 "Auto-complete"): a delayed BullMQ job scheduled
// at CONFIRM time for EVERY confirmed booking (all payment_modes — not just
// prepay). If the booking is still `confirmed` when the job fires (`ends_at +
// grace`), it transitions to `completed` with `actor = system`, which already
// triggers Phase 4 Task 9's capture + commission accrual
// (BookingStatusService.completeBooking -> BookingCompletionHook) and opens
// review eligibility. Closes the review-veto (a vendor can't block a review,
// or commission accrual, by never marking completion themselves) and makes
// prepay capture independent of vendor diligence.
//
// Wiring mirrors booking-auth.service.ts's shape closely (delayed job with a
// deterministic jobId, re-time/remove helpers, a narrow StatusTransitioner-
// shaped seam back into BookingStatusService to avoid a circular import) —
// see that file's own header comment for the general pattern this follows.

// would assume capture happens 24h earlier/later than it actually does,

 * `rescheduleAutoCompleteJob` has no caller yet on this branch — Tasks 3/4
 * (reschedule/cancel routes) don't exist. It's exposed as a clean seam for
 * those tasks: once a booking's `ends_at` changes (reschedule-completion),
 * the flow driving that MUST call this with the booking's NEW `ends_at` (the
 * cleanup branch above only REMOVES the stale job on the `rescheduled`
 * transition; it does not know the new slot to re-schedule for).
 *
 * The BullMQ Worker (booking-autocomplete.job.ts) that actually processes the
