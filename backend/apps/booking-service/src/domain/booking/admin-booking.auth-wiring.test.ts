// admin-booking.auth-wiring.test.ts
//
// admin-booking.routes.test.ts only proves 401-on-unauthenticated for the
// three admin booking paths. That is necessary but not sufficient: a guard
// mis-wiring that 401s EVERY caller unconditionally (the historical bug class
// in this repo — omitting `jwtAuth` from the guard's own Elysia instance, see
// project_elysia_guard_wiring) would produce byte-identical results to the
// unauthenticated tests. This file proves the POSITIVE direction: a valid
// customer JWT is rejected with 403 (not 401) — i.e. requireRole is actually
// discriminating on role, not just requiring "any token" — and a valid admin
// JWT gets PAST jwtAuth + requireRole("admin", "super_admin") into the
// handler. It also proves ?page=-5 is rejected as a 400 validation error
// before the handler runs, for an authenticated admin caller.
//
// NO DB, NO mock.module: this file imports the REAL ../../app.ts, same as
// its sibling admin-booking.routes.test.ts and the service-root
// route-auth-wiring.test.ts. An earlier version of this file mock.module'd
// ../../container.ts down to a stub so the positive-path assertions could
// check res.status === 200 against recorded stub calls. That worked when
// this file ran alone, but bun:test's module registry is process-wide: when
// the whole service runs as one `bun test src/` process, route-auth-wiring.test.ts
// (src/route-auth-wiring.test.ts) statically imports the real app.ts, which
// transitively imports the real ../../container.ts — and whichever import
// wins the race owns the "../../container.ts" specifier for the rest of the
// process. The mock lost that race (confirmed empirically, and not
// reliably fixable by filename/ordering tricks), so the "positive" tests hit
// the real, DB-less BookingQueryService and failed with
// `No metadata for "Booking" was found` instead of the stubbed 200. Rather
// than re-fight that race, this file asserts only what's true without a DB
// or a stub:
//   - jwtAuth + requireRole run BEFORE any service is touched (401 vs 403
//     vs "reached the handler" are all decided pre-DB), so those properties
//     are safe to assert against the real app.
//   - The query schema (t.Numeric with a minimum) is validated by Elysia
//     BEFORE the handler runs, so ?page=-5 -> 400 needs no DB either.
//   - "The admin JWT got past the guard" is asserted as a NEGATIVE property
//     (status is neither 401 nor 403) rather than a positive 200, because
//     past the guard the handler calls the real bookingQueryService, which
//     has no initialised DataSource in this test process and throws — caught
//     by errorHandler and turned into a 500. That 500 is the expected,
//     meaningful outcome here: it is proof the request cleared jwtAuth and
//     requireRole and reached application code, not evidence of a broken
//     test. (This is the same DB-less-500-as-proof-of-reachability pattern
//     used for the real Booking metadata error this file was originally
//     written to route around.)
