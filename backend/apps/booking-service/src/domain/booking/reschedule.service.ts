// reschedule.service.ts
//
// Phase 5 Task 3 (spec §5.3 reschedule). A confirmed booking is moved to a
// NEW slot the customer picked via the existing hold flow (POST /bookings/hold
// -> Redis hold token). The state machine passes through
// `confirmed -> rescheduled -> confirmed` (the `rescheduled` marker is
// recorded in booking_status_history; the booking ENDS confirmed with the new
// times). Money carries over unchanged — no refund/charge on reschedule.
//
// Ordering (why the engagement move happens BEFORE the status transitions):
// the capacity-ledger engagement is the write-side arbiter. We move it (and
// update the bookings row's times/staff) inside ONE transaction FIRST, while
// the booking is still `confirmed`. If the GiST EXCLUDE `no_double_book`
// constraint rejects the new range (`23P01`), that transaction rolls back and
// EngagementService.move surfaces it as a 409 ConflictError — the booking is
// left completely untouched (still confirmed on its OLD slot), never stranded
// mid-way in the `rescheduled` marker state. Only AFTER the move commits do we
// record the two audit transitions and re-time the delayed jobs.
//
// Availability cache: EngagementService.move invalidates BOTH the old and new
// staff/day keys itself; the rescheduled->confirmed transition additionally
// re-confirms the engagement (idempotent) which re-invalidates the new day.
