// booking-money.ts
//
// Small shared money helpers for the confirmed-booking terminal flows that move
// money per the SNAPSHOTTED policy (cancel.service.ts, no-show.service.ts). Both
// are siblings in domain/booking/ and derive "how much was actually taken/held"
// and "which Stripe PaymentIntent backs the authorization" identically — this
// module is the one place that logic lives so the two services can't drift.
//
// Deliberately NOT folded into either service (the brief: "do not fold no-show
// into cancel"): each service owns its own window/policy DECISION and its own
// gateway ACTION switch (the reference_type + the semantics differ — an
// out-of-window cancel VOIDs a zero-forfeit prepay hold, a no-show has no window
// at all). This module only shares the two mechanical, side-effect-light bits.

// The recoverable/held amount per payment_mode, derived from the booking's
// snapshot columns — NOT from `amount_paid_fils`, which is never written back
// after creation (defaults to 0, no confirm/deposit-capture path updates it),
// so it can't be the basis for refund/forfeit math. See cancel.service.ts's
// header for the full rationale.

//                          manual-capture authorization hold on escrow_hold_id)
//   - prepay (unauthorized) / pay_at_venue: 0 (nothing taken or held)
