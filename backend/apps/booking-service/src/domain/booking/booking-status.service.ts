  /**
   * PHASE 7 REVIEW FIX #1 — the ATOMIC `confirmed -> rescheduled -> confirmed`
   * pair (spec §5.3 reschedule), replacing RescheduleService's two independent
   * `transition()` calls.
   *
   * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: those two calls were two separate committed
   * transactions with no outer transaction and no compensation. Between them
   * the row was durably `rescheduled` — and `rescheduled` is a DEAD END in
   * practice:
   *   - `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS[rescheduled]` admits only `confirmed`, and the
   *     ONLY producer of that edge was the second call itself.
   *   - cancel / no-show / reschedule all hard-require `status === confirmed`.
   *   - `confirm()` no-ops for anything that isn't `pending_payment`.
   *   - BookingReaperService only scans `pending_payment`.
   * So a crash / pod-roll / connection drop between the two commits left the
   * booking unreachable by EVERY api and job: slot blocked forever, the Stripe
   * authorization left open, and — worst — the `rescheduled` cleanup branch
   * above had ALREADY torn down the auth / auto-complete / reminder jobs while
   * RescheduleService's re-arm (which runs after BOTH transitions) never ran.
   *
   * WHY THIS CLOSES THE WINDOW: both conditional UPDATEs and both history rows
   * commit inside ONE transaction, so `rescheduled` is never a COMMITTED state
   * — no crash can be observed with the row parked there. The transaction
   * either commits whole (booking is `confirmed` on its new slot, with both
   * audit rows) or rolls back whole (booking is `confirmed`, untouched). Either
   * outcome is a state every existing api and job can already act on, so there
   * is no longer any instant at which the booking is strandable.
   *
   * Both edges are still validated against ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS (this method
   * grants no new edge — it just refuses to leave the intermediate one
   * durable), both history rows are still written, and the delayed-job cleanup
   * still fires after commit exactly as the `rescheduled` branch did, so
   * RescheduleService's re-arm contract is unchanged.

  /**
   * The webhook-success entry point (prepay=SetupIntent succeeded,
   * deposit=captured — Task 3 calls this). Transitions
   * `pending_payment -> confirmed` with `actor = system`, then fires the
   * seams below. Idempotent: Stripe webhooks retry under at-least-once
   * delivery, so a booking that's already `confirmed` is a safe no-op rather
   * than an `InvalidBookingTransitionError` throw.
   *
   * FINAL REVIEW FIX: widened from "no-op only when already confirmed" to
   * "no-op for ANY status other than pending_payment". Two cross-task races
   * land a late Stripe `payment_intent.succeeded` / `setup_intent.succeeded`
   * here (carrying `metadata.booking_id`) after the booking has already
   * moved on to a DIFFERENT non-confirmed status:
   *   - Task 9 completion: capturing the prepay authorization PI flips that
   *     PI to `succeeded` -> Stripe fires `payment_intent.succeeded` ->
   *     order-service's webhook routes it here -> but the booking is
   *     ALREADY `completed` (completion transitions to `completed` BEFORE
   *     the capture happens). This fires on EVERY prepay completion — the
   *     mainline path, not an edge case.
   *   - Reaper-vs-late-webhook race: the reaper expires (or a future
   *     Phase 5 cancel-with-refund cancels) a `pending_payment` booking,
   *     and its late setup_intent/payment_intent then succeeds anyway ->
   *     confirm() sees `expired`/`cancelled`.
   * Previously only `status === confirmed` short-circuited; every OTHER
   * non-pending_payment status fell through to
   * `transitionGuarded(..., confirmed, ...)`, and terminal statuses have no
   * outgoing edge in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` -> `InvalidBookingTransitionError`
   * (422) -> the webhook handler marked the event `failed` and Stripe
   * retried FOREVER. This guard now treats anything other than
   * `pending_payment` as a safe, non-throwing no-op — it does NOT re-run the
   * transition, re-write history, or re-fire the confirm seams
   * (scheduleBookingAuthJob / enqueuePostConfirmHooks).
