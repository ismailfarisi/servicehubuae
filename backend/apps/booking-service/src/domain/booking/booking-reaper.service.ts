 * they hold via `BookingStatusService.transition` (Phase 4 Task 6 — that
 * call already releases the `staff_engagement` and invalidates the
 * availability cache internally; this service never touches the engagement
 * directly). After the booking is durably `expired`, it makes a
 * BEST-EFFORT attempt to void any outstanding Stripe hold via
 * `BookingPaymentClient` (money stays in order-service — this never talks
 * to Stripe directly): a deposit booking's uncaptured PaymentIntent gets
 * voided; a prepay booking's SetupIntent holds no money at all (it's a
 * saved-card verification, not a charge) and `BookingPaymentClient` has no
 * setup-intent-cancel method, so that leg is cleanup-only and is skipped
 * with a log line rather than attempted.
 *
 * Order matters, mirrored from the Task 7 brief: the slot is freed
 * UNCONDITIONALLY (the transition happens first); the payment void is
 * strictly best-effort afterward — a void failure is logged and counted in
 * `errored` but never un-expires the booking or blocks the sweep from
 * continuing to the next candidate (mirrors
 * PendingOrderReaperService.reapExpired's per-item try/catch).

   * PHASE 7 REVIEW FIX #2 — never expire a booking whose deposit was already
   * captured.
   *
   * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: this method's predecessor transitioned to `expired`
   * UNCONDITIONALLY and only then made a best-effort void. But deposit
   * PaymentIntents are CAPTURE-NOW (BookingService.create), so if Stripe's
   * `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook is merely DELAYED past
   * BOOKING_PENDING_EXPIRY_MINUTES (default 60), the customer's money is
   * already taken. `paymentClient.void` (= `paymentIntents.cancel`) then
   * ERRORS on a succeeded PI, that error was swallowed into a log line, and
   * the later webhook's `confirm()` no-ops because the booking is no longer
   * `pending_payment`. Net: customer charged, booking expired, slot resold, no
   * refund, no reconciliation record.
   *
   * WHY THE NEW ORDER CLOSES THE WINDOW: for deposit bookings the money is now
   * settled BEFORE the slot is freed, and every branch is fail-CLOSED —
   * nothing expires unless we have positive evidence no money is held:
   *
   *   1. Payment row already `captured`/`authorized`/`refunded`/
   *      `partially_refunded` -> the money side has ALREADY moved. Do not
   *      expire. Drive `statusService.confirm()` instead — that is precisely
   *      what the delayed webhook would have done, it is idempotent, and it is
   *      the semantic the rest of the service uses for "payment succeeded ⇒
   *      booking confirmed". Confirming (rather than refunding) is the right
   *      match here: the customer paid for a slot that is still theirs and
   *      still unsold, so honouring it is strictly better for them than
   *      cancelling-and-refunding a booking they wanted.
   *   2. Otherwise VOID FIRST, expire second. A void that SUCCEEDS proves the
   *      PI was uncaptured and is now cancelled — only then is it safe to free
   *      the slot. A void that THROWS (the succeeded-PI case, or order-service
   *      being down) leaves the booking `pending_payment` and counts as
   *      `errored` with a loud reconciliation-required log — the next sweep
   *      retries, and a late webhook can still confirm it. The failure is no
   *      longer swallowed into a log line while the booking expires anyway.
   *
   * prepay (SetupIntent — no money held) and pay_at_venue are unaffected and
   * keep the original expire-then-cleanup ordering.
