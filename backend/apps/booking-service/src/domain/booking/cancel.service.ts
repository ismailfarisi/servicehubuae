// cancel.service.ts
//
// Phase 5 Task 4 (spec §5.3 "cancelled (customer/admin) --> refund per policy").
// A confirmed booking is cancelled; the slot is freed and the money outcome is
// driven by the SNAPSHOTTED cancellation policy via the pure
// BookingPolicyCalculator (booking-policy.ts). Separate file mirroring
// reschedule.service.ts — one responsibility per file.
//
// ── Ordering (mirrors BookingReaperService.reapExpired) ──────────────────────
// The slot is freed UNCONDITIONALLY first, via
// BookingStatusService.transition(bookingId, cancelled, actor). That single
// call: (a) writes the ONE booking_status_history audit row (with our
// refund/forfeit-bearing `reason`), (b) releases the staff_engagement (frees
// the slot + invalidates the availability cache), and (c) fires the stale
// delayed-job CLEANUP for ALL THREE jobs (booking-auth, auto-complete,
// reminders) — because container.ts constructs bookingStatusService with all
// three hooks wired, its `cancelled` cleanup branch removes every one (verified:
// booking-status.service.ts's reachedCleanupTargetStatus block). So unlike
// reschedule (which must RE-TIME jobs for a new slot), cancel needs no explicit
// job calls here — removal is exactly what the terminal transition already does.
//
// The money movement is strictly BEST-EFFORT and runs AFTER the transition, so
// a void/capture/refund failure never un-cancels the booking or strands the
// slot (an unvoided uncaptured PI auto-expires at Stripe in ~7 days — the same
// safety property BookingReaperService.voidOutstandingPayment and
// BookingAuthService.rescheduleBookingAuthJob rely on). A failure is logged
// loudly for ops follow-up (there is no self-serve retry — the booking is no
// longer `confirmed`).
//
// ── Money basis (what was actually taken/held) ──────────────────────────────
// `booking.amount_paid_fils` is CURRENTLY never written back after creation
// (it defaults to 0 and no confirm/deposit-capture path updates it), so it is
// NOT a reliable basis for the refund/forfeit math. Instead the recoverable
// amount is derived per payment_mode from the snapshot columns:
//   - deposit:            deposit_fils   (the amount captured at booking time —
//                         BookingService.create() creates the deposit intent for
//                         exactly `depositFils`).
//   - prepay (authorized): price_fils - amount_paid_fils  (the off-session
//                         manual-capture authorization hold — mirrors
//                         BookingAuthService.authorizeNow's own amount).
//   - prepay (unauthorized) / pay_at_venue: 0 (nothing taken or held).
// That derived amount is passed to computeCancellation as `amountPaidFils`,
// which the pure calculator caps every forfeit against.
