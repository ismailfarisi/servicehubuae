// can never expire before `completed` captures it (Stripe card
// authorizations are valid ~7 days).

// Money boundary: this NEVER talks to a payment provider directly — it calls
// `BookingPaymentGateway.authorize()`. The one piece of card data

// customer/payment-method ids inside `gateway_response`), the same way
// booking-reaper.service.ts reads `payments.gateway_payment_id` to resolve a
// deposit's payment id. That is a read of already-stored, non-money data, not
// a write and not a provider call. Until online payments ship (M2) no prepay
// booking can be created, so this job has nothing to authorize.

   *      over — no refund/charge on reschedule"). Nothing to do.
   *   3. Already authorized but the reschedule pushed the capture deadline
   *      BEYOND what the existing auth can support (reachable whenever
   *      reschedule_window_hours < cancellation_window_hours + 24h — the
   *      normal config — lets an already-authorized booking move weeks out):
   *      carrying the auth over would let it silently expire before
   *      auto-complete captures it (vendor performs the service, capture
   *      fails). Instead: void the stale authorization (best-effort — an
   *      unvoided uncaptured PI auto-expires at Stripe in ~7 days, so a

   *      a few extra days), clear `escrow_hold_id` (the ONLY ref Task 9's
