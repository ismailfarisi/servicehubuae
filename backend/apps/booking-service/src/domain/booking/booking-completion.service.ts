/**
 * PHASE 7 REVIEW FIX #4 — thrown when a PREPAY booking reaches completion with
 * no capturable authorization.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: the old code logged a warning and STILL called
 * `paymentClient.complete({ paymentIntentId: null, ... })`. VERIFIED against
 * order-service's `/internal/booking-payments/complete`
 * (apps/order-service/src/routes/internal-booking-payment.routes.ts): a null
 * `payment_intent_id` skips the Stripe capture entirely but STILL runs
 * `commissionService.createForBookingInTx` — i.e. it posts the commission /
 * payout accrual regardless. So a prepay booking whose auth job died (very
 * reachable before fix #3 gave that queue any retries at all) auto-completed
 * at ends_at+24h with ZERO collected and the vendor credited anyway.
 *
 * Throwing rather than logging is deliberate and matches
 * `BookingStatusService.completeBooking`'s documented contract: the status
 * transition has ALREADY durably committed, so a throw here does not undo the
 * completion — it signals "the money side did not finish, call
 * completeBooking() again". The auto-complete queue's `attempts: 3` retries
 * it, and an exhausted job lands in BullMQ's failed set, which IS the
 * reconciliation record. Either the missing authorization gets resolved and a
 * later retry captures + accrues correctly, or a human sees a failed job —
 * both strictly better than silently crediting the vendor for money nobody
 * ever collected.

 * resolves WHICH PaymentIntent to capture and delegates to
 * `BookingPaymentClient.complete`.
 *
 * PI resolution mirrors BookingReaperService.settleDepositBeforeExpiry /
 * BookingAuthService's own lookups: booking-service reads the shared
 * `payments` table directly (same Postgres via `@mypickuae/database`, read-only)
 * rather than exposing a new order-service lookup endpoint for a single

 * authorization PaymentIntent's Payment-ROW id on `booking.escrow_hold_id`
 * (NOT `booking.payment_id`, which for prepay points at the SetupIntent
 * instead) — so `escrow_hold_id -> payments.id -> gateway_payment_id` is the
 * one true path to the PI capture needs.
