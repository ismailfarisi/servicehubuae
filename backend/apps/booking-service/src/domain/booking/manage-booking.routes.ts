// manage-booking.routes.ts
//
// Staff-facing booking-management actions (Phase 5 Task 5, spec §5.3). Separate
// from booking.routes.ts because the guard differs: these are NOT customer
// endpoints — the marking actor is platform staff. Kept in its own Elysia scope
// (its own requireRole) rather than mixed into booking.routes.ts's
// `requireRole("customer", ...)` scope.
//
// ── Exposure decision (mirrors how Phase 4's completeBooking is reachable) ────
// BookingStatusService.completeBooking has NO dedicated customer/vendor HTTP
// route — it's reachable only via the auto-complete job + internal/admin paths.
// No-show follows the same posture: gated to platform staff (admin/super_admin),
// who legitimately act on ANY booking (loaded by id, no ownership scoping —
// exactly like admin cancel in booking.routes.ts). NoShowService.markNoShow
// itself accepts any NON-customer actor (it throws ForbiddenError on a customer),
// so the eventual VENDOR / location-admin manage surface — which needs
// vendor_members ownership scoping (a vendor must only no-show THEIR OWN
// bookings) that doesn't exist in booking-service's route layer yet — can call
// the SAME service method once that scoping lands.
//
// >>> Phase 7 manage-surface gap: FILLED (Task 0B). The vendor/location-manager
// mutations (complete / no-show / reschedule) now live in
// manage-booking-actions.routes.ts under the `/manage/bookings/:id/*` prefix,
// gated by `vendorMembership("products.write")` with vendor_members-based
// ownership scoping (booking.vendor_id === member.vid) + location scope, and
// they DELEGATE to the same completion/no-show/reschedule services this admin
// route family uses. This route below stays as the PLATFORM-STAFF
// (admin/super_admin) no-show path — act-on-any, no vendor ownership scoping.
