 * Producer-only handle on product-service's service-search-sync queue.
 *
 * booking-service owns vendor_locations and service_areas, but the Typesense
 * index that depends on them lives in product-service. Rather than an HTTP
 * call, we enqueue on the shared Redis and let product-service's worker do
 * the re-index — the same producer-only pattern as
 * `getNotificationEventsQueue()` in domain/reminders/booking-reminder.job.ts,
 * which feeds notification-service.
 *
 * The queue name and payload shape are duplicated from product-service on
 * purpose: the two services are separate deployables and must not import each
 * other. If either changes, both sides change together.
