// Redis read-model for the availability engine. The cached value is the set of
// FREE windows for one staff member on one calendar day, and it is
// OFFERING-AGNOSTIC: it holds working-hours minus busy time, before any
// per-offering duration/buffer slicing. That keeps a single cache entry reusable
// across every service a staff member performs; slicing happens after read.
// Vendor holidays are deliberately NOT baked in — they are written by
// vendor-service, which cannot invalidate this cache, so the read side
// subtracts them fresh on every request (see AvailabilityService).
//
// KEY SHAPE: `avail:{staffId}:{localDay}` is a HASH keyed by IANA timezone.
// The cached windows are computed from dayRangeUtc(day, timezone), so the same
// local-day label means a DIFFERENT UTC span per zone — a staff member shared
// between a Dubai and a London branch must not read each other's windows.
// Keeping the timezone as a hash FIELD (rather than in the key) lets the
// tz-blind write-side invalidators drop every zone's copy with one DEL.
//
// DEGRADATION CONTRACT:
//  - reads/writes never throw: a Redis failure falls through to compute, so
//    availability is never blocked by a cache outage;
//  - a failed INVALIDATION is not swallowed as "fine". Because we cannot prove
//    the stale entry is gone, the cache goes BLIND (read-through + no writes)
//    for one full TTL, by which point any entry we failed to delete has expired
//    on its own. Serving a known-stale free window would sell a booked slot;
//    recomputing for a few minutes only costs CPU.
