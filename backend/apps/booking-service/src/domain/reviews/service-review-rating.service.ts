// service-review-rating.service.ts
//
// Phase 5 Task 7 (spec §4.3/§7 "Feeds staff_member.rating + vendor rating_avg
// via the existing review-rating worker pattern"). Recompute-from-aggregate
// (AVG over approved reviews), mirroring order-service's
// apps/order-service/src/domain/reviews/review-rating.job.ts — but implemented
// as a directly-callable class here (no BullMQ queue/worker) rather than the
// enqueue-then-async-worker shape that job uses. Two reasons:
//   1. order-service's worker is a Review/Product/Vendor-specific BullMQ
//      consumer — it can't take a ServiceReview payload (different job shape,
//      different tables), so a straight "reuse" wasn't possible; this is the
//      brief's "parallel worker" fallback.
//   2. Booking reviews are created already `approved` (see
//      service-review.service.ts's module doc), and the brief's live-DB test
//      requires ratings to be visibly updated immediately after a review is
//      created — an async queue hop would make that assertion racy. A plain
//      awaited call keeps the effect synchronous with create(), same as this
//      module's caller expects.
//
// ── staff_member.rating: straightforward — only service_reviews writes it. ──
//
// ── vendor.rating_avg: SHARED with product reviews ──────────────────────────
// order-service's review-rating.job.ts ALSO writes `vendors.rating_avg`, from
// the product-catalog `reviews` table. A naive service_reviews-only recompute
// here would clobber that (a vendor selling both products and bookable
// services would flip-flop between a product-only and a service-only average
// depending on which side last wrote). Recompute is done here as a BLENDED
// aggregate across both `reviews` and `service_reviews` (UNION ALL, one
// physical Postgres instance/schema — booking-service already reads
// Vendor/Category/SiteSetting directly across the service boundary, see
// commission-snapshot.service.ts's doc comment for the same precedent).
//
// KEEP IN SYNC (both sides now blend): as of commit 494664a6,
// order-service's review-rating.job.ts (recomputeReviewRatings) ALSO recomputes
// `vendors.rating_avg` as the SAME blended UNION over product `reviews` +
// `service_reviews`, with identical status='approved' + deleted_at IS NULL
// predicates — so a product-review approval no longer clobbers the
// service-review component (the drift this class's blend was originally added
// to work around). The two recomputes are now mirror images: whichever review
// (product or booking) last changes recomputes the SAME blended average, so
// they converge instead of flip-flopping. Any change to the blend's predicates
// here MUST be mirrored in order-service's recomputeReviewRatings (and vice
// versa) or the two writers desync again.

// without also reading `rating_count`. `avg` is now explicitly `null` for the
// no-rows case so the caller decides, rather than the parser silently
// inventing a rating. (A NULL `avg` and `count === 0` always travel together:

// this fix (see the report). Until the columns are made nullable, "no reviews"
// is written as the 0/0 pair, which IS unambiguous when read together:
// ratings are constrained to 1..5, so `rating_count = 0` is the only way
// `rating` can be 0. The `null` above keeps that decision explicit and in ONE
// place, so flipping to a real NULL is a one-line change here once the columns
// allow it.
