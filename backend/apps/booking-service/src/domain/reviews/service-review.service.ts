// service-review.service.ts
//
// Phase 5 Task 7 (spec §4.3/§7 "Booking-gated reviews"). A customer reviews a
// booking after it completes; a vendor may reply once. Separate file mirroring
// cancel.service.ts/no-show.service.ts — one responsibility per file.
//
// ── Gate (brief) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Allowed only if: the booking belongs to the customer (ownership -> 404,
// matching every other customer booking endpoint's not-mine-or-doesn't-exist
// convention — see booking.routes.ts's GET /bookings/:id comment) AND
// booking.status === completed (not-yet-completed -> 403 — the brief names
// 403 explicitly; this is a DELIBERATE departure from the booking
// state-machine's usual 422 InvalidBookingTransitionError, because a review
// isn't a booking-status transition at all) AND no existing review for the
// booking (409, uq_service_reviews_booking backstops the race — see
// isUniqueViolation below).
//
// ── Moderation status: `approved`, not the product-review-precedent `pending`
// (DESIGN DEVIATION — flagged in the Task 7 report) ─────────────────────────
// order-service's ReviewService.createReview (apps/order-service/src/domain/
// reviews/review.service.ts) creates product reviews as `pending` and only
// enqueues the rating recompute from `approveReview` (an admin moderation
// action). booking-service has NO admin approve/reject/list surface for
// service_reviews anywhere (not built by any prior task, not in this task's
// brief) — mirroring `pending` verbatim would mean a booking review NEVER
// visibly affects staff_member.rating / vendor.rating_avg, which contradicts
// the brief's own live-DB test ("after completion -> created + ratings
// updated"). Booking reviews are also more inherently trustworthy than the
// open product-review path: they're gated on a REAL completed booking the
// caller owns (is_verified defaults true off booking_id by construction,
// same reasoning as product's is_verified_purchase), one per booking. Given
// that, new reviews are created directly `approved`. The `pending`/`rejected`/
// `flagged` states are kept on the enum for a future admin-moderation phase
// (flagging abuse etc.) — same "documented gap, Phase 7" posture Task 5 used
// for the no-show vendor-route surface — they're just not reachable from this
// task's endpoints.
//
// ── Rating recompute reachability (Phase 7 review, finding 8) ──────────────
// `ratingRecomputer.recompute` is currently only reachable from create().
// There is NO delete / soft-delete / moderation endpoint for service_reviews
// anywhere on this branch (grep: nothing outside this module writes the
// table), so nothing can silently drift today. But the aggregates are
// recompute-from-scratch over `status = approved AND deleted_at IS NULL`, so
// the FIRST endpoint that soft-deletes a review or moves it off `approved`
// MUST call recompute({ vendorId, staffMemberId }) after the write, exactly
// as create() does below — otherwise staff_member.rating / vendor.rating_avg
// keep counting a review that is no longer visible.

   *
   * Phase 7 review (finding 7): the permission gate alone is NOT the whole
