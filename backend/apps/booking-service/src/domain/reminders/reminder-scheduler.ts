// .service.ts) — `_` is the established separator on this branch.
//
// ── Why the jobId is SLOT-VERSIONED (Phase 7 review, findings 3 + 4) ────────
// The id carries a token derived from the booking's `starts_at`, so a job
// scheduled for one slot can never collide with a job scheduled for another.
// That single change closes two races the previous stable-id scheme had:
//
//  (3) BookingStatusService fires `removeReminderJobs(bookingId)` UN-awaited
//      on the confirmed -> rescheduled transition, while the reschedule flow
//      awaits `rescheduleReminderJobs`. With stable ids the late remove could
//      land AFTER the re-add and delete the fresh jobs, leaving the booking
//      with ZERO reminders. With slot-versioned ids the stale remove can only
//      target the OLD slot's ids (it removes a snapshot taken synchronously
//      at call time — see removeReminderJobs), so it is physically unable to
//      touch the new slot's jobs no matter when it lands.
//
//  (4) `queue.add` with an ALREADY-EXISTING jobId is a SILENT no-op on
//      BullMQ. So a swallowed `queue.remove` failure used to pin the reminder
//      to the OLD fire time (booking moved Fri->Mon, reminder still fires
//      Friday) with nothing downstream to catch it. A new slot means a new
//      id, so the re-add ALWAYS lands; and any surviving old-slot job is
//      rejected at delivery time by runReminderJob's `expectedStartsAt`
//      fingerprint check.
//
// Jobs enqueued by the PREVIOUS (unversioned) code are still removed by
// removeReminderJobs via legacyReminderJobId, and are still safe if they
// survive: they carry no `expectedStartsAt`, so they fall back to the plain
// status check exactly as before.
