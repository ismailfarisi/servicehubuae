// Each candidate is checked via assertLocationManager; failures (wrong vendor,
// no managing membership, deleted location) are swallowed and collapse to
// `false`, since callers must not leak *why* access was denied.
//
// ── Why ALL and not ANY (review finding 7) ──────────────────────────────────
// This replaces an `isLocationManagerOfAny` that returned true if the actor
// managed ANY ONE of the candidates and never compared the TARGET to the
// actor's own branch. Because the candidate list is "every branch this staff
// member works at", a staff member shared between branches A and B made every
// object hanging off them reachable from EITHER branch: a single-branch admin
// at A could delete a block created at B, replace B's iCal subscription, and
// read a personal-calendar secret configured by B's manager.
//
// The objects these callers guard (staff_engagements rows, staff calendar
// subscriptions) carry no branch of their own in the schema, so the target's
// branch cannot be compared directly. ALL is the correct rule under that
// uncertainty: authorize only when every branch the target could belong to is
// one the actor already manages. A shared staff member therefore falls back to
// owner/vendor-manager, who always retain access — so no vendor is ever locked
// out of their own data, they just need the vendor-wide role for a resource
// that spans branches.
//
// An EMPTY candidate list returns false for a non-owner/manager: a target with
// no branch at all is not scoped to anyone's branch, so only the vendor-wide
// roles may touch it (same posture as the home-visit booking branch in
// manage-booking-actions.controller.ts).
