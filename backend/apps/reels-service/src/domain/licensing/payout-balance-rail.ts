/**
 * Reserves against the vendor's accrued-but-unpaid earnings. Availability =
 *   SUM(commissions.vendor_earning WHERE vendor_id AND status='pending'
 *       AND payout_id IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL)
 *   - SUM(active payout-balance holds: status IN ('held','captured') AND settled_payout_id IS NULL)
 *
 * R4 (payout correctness): `payout_id IS NULL` is part of the payable
 * predicate everywhere else and was missing here - the structurally identical
 * sibling of getAdminSummary.total_pending_fils. Without it a vendor could
 * license a reel against earnings a draft payout had already claimed and was
 * about to transfer: the same fils spent twice. The two sides stay consistent
 * because a draft claims the holds at the same moment it claims the
 * commissions (createDraft), so a claimed hold leaves the subtrahend exactly
 * as its commissions leave the sum.
 * A `held` row IS the reservation; capture flips it to `captured` (still subtracted
 * from availability until a vendor payout settles it — see order-service payout.service).
