/**
 * The creator's own media-kit editor.
 *
 * Read-your-writes on a single row: GET returns null before the creator has
 * ever saved (the editor renders an empty form), PUT upserts.
 *
 * There is no publish step. Saving is what makes the kit visible on the vendor
 * directory's detail page — the service forces `is_published` true on every
 * upsert, and the field is not accepted from the body.
 *
 * Like creator-directory.routes.ts, the service is imported as a named
 * singleton rather than decorated onto the container: one more `.decorate`
 * tips admin-analytics.routes.ts into TS2589 (see container.ts).
