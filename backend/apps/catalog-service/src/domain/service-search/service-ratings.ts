// ServiceReviewRatingService.recomputeVendor (service-review-rating.service.ts):
// a moderator rejecting/flagging a review must not keep contributing to the
// public rating shown on /services or to the min_rating filter. The cast is
// needed because `service_reviews.status` is its own Postgres enum type
// (service_reviews_status_enum); comparing it to a plain string parameter
// without the cast risks a 42883 type-inference error on some drivers.
//
// `service_reviews` has NO `service_offering_id` column of its own — a
// review is keyed by `booking_id`, and the offering is a nullable column on
// `bookings` (nullable because Phase 6 walk-in/phone bookings can have no
// offering picked). So the aggregate must join through bookings and group on
// `b.service_offering_id`. `b.deleted_at IS NULL` is included alongside
// `r.deleted_at IS NULL`: a soft-deleted booking is treated the same as a
// soft-deleted review — its review should stop contributing to the public
// rating shown on /services.
