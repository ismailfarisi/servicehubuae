# Register (or re-register) the Cloudflare Stream webhook endpoint for an account
# and print the HMAC secret from the response.
#
# Cloudflare Stream allows ONE webhook URL + ONE secret per entire account,
# managed only via the API. There is no dashboard UI. The secret is revealed
# exactly once in the PUT response and cannot be queried later.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/register-cloudflare-stream-webhook.sh <account_id> <api_token> <url>
#
# Example:
#   scripts/register-cloudflare-stream-webhook.sh \
#     abc123def456 \
#     eyJhbGciOi... \
#     https://api.stage.mypickuae.com/reels/webhooks/cloudflare-stream
#
# Requires: curl, jq (for pretty output). If jq isn't installed the raw JSON
# is printed so you can grep the secret manually.
#
# Save the resulting secret to:
#   - terraform/staging/terraform.tfvars (cloudflare_stream_webhook_secret)
#   - the running EC2's /opt/mypickuae/.env (CLOUDFLARE_STREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
# and restart reels-service to pick it up.
