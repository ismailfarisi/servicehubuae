				<p>
					Beauty in the UAE is plural. A skincare regimen begins in Seoul,
					travels through Paris, and ends with an oud sprayed in Sharjah.
					Buying it should feel that effortless — one cart, one delivery,
					one customer service line, in the language you actually speak.
				</p>
				<p>
					MyPickUAE exists so customers don&rsquo;t have to choose between
					a global edit and a regional one. We work directly with vendors
					to surface only authentic stock, ship from inside the country,
					and price in fils, not guesses.
